The aim of this `{shiny}` application (packaged under `{eneRgyVD}`) is to provide communes and citizens of Canton de Vaud with energy statistics, mostly at communal level, through an accessible and documented plateform.

The app is built and maintained by the *data and indicators unit* at [Direction de l'énergie du Canton de Vaud](https://www.vd.ch/toutes-les-autorites/departements/departement-de-la-jeunesse-de-lenvironnement-et-de-la-securite-djes/direction-generale-de-lenvironnement-dge/diren-energie).

The data will be updated regularly when new data is available or when the methodology has been improved.

New datasets will be uploaded when available. 

Any broken or suboptimal feature can be directly reported at [stat-energie@vd.ch](mailto:stat-energie@vd.ch). 


## Production version

The latest stable release of the application is deployed here (since 2023-06-19): [https://stat-energie-vd.ch/profil-energie/](https://stat-energie-vd.ch/profil-energie/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of eneRgyVD like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mick-weber/eneRgyVD")

```
## Launching the app locally

After installing, you can call `library(eneRgyVD)` and then simply run `run_app()` to launch the app on a local instance. Please note that for performance-related reasons, the raw datafiles are not provided on GitHub. However, all the `.rda` files are available in the `data/` subfolder.

For technical reasons, downloading an energy report from a local instance of the application will not work.
