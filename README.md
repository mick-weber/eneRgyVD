# **Welcome to eneRgyVD** ! 

This R Shiny app, built upon a `{golem}` framework, is used by the Direction de l'énergie of Canton de Vaud (Switzerland) to share statistics about municipalities in canton de Vaud.

The app's latest production version is deployed here : https://stat-energie-vd.ch/profil-energie under the name *Profil énergétique des communes vaudoises*.

Early 2024, a new version based on `{bslib}` has been developed to upgrade from Bootstrap 4 to 5.
