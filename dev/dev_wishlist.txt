# Access number of facets

Anytime when using the number of facets in a facetted plot, I access it through ggbuild(ggplot) etc. which is a mess to do

A better alternative, since 1 facet = 1 commune, is to use length(inputVals$selectedCommunes) instead. This makes it one value modified at top-level of the app, rather than accessing multiple times in each plot
