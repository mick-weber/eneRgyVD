\description{
The dataset is an agregation and simplification of all electricity production
installations recorded in canton de Vaud by PRONOVO AG. The data is split by
category of installation (i.e. photovolta√Øcs, wind turbines, etc.). The data
results in a fairly complex methodology where DGE-DIREN provides some estimates
for some type of installation which production is not recorded, or for self-consumption.
The data is accompanied with a separate dictionnary dataset `elec_prod_doc`.
