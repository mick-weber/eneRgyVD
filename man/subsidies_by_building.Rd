\description{
The dataset is an agregation and simplification of the main subsidies paid by
Etat de Vaud for renovation and changes of heat producers in buildings. The
programm is called "Programme BÃ¢timents", and the primary data source is
IWF's platform used to process the subsidies. Data is acquired
through a authentified API by DGE-DIREN, and data is pre-processed locally
before making it available to the application.
Energy-units should be expressed in kWh, and CO2 in tons.
