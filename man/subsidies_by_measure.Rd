\description{
The dataset is a reflection of the main subsidies paid by Etat de Vaud for
renovation and changes of heat producers in buildings. The
program is called "Programme BÃ¢timents", and the primary data source is
IWF's platform used to process the subsidies. Data is acquired
through an authenticated API by DGE-DIREN, and data is pre-processed locally
before making it available to the application.
Energy-units should be expressed in kWh, and CO2 in tons.
